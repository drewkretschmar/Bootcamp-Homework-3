This project utlizies the introductory aspects of Javascript that I learned this past week. Using prompts and confirm methods, I can collect different criteria to form a new, random passowrd based off of the collected information. Then, utilizing the collected criteria and a series of if, if else, and else statements, I can generate a random password.
